## Manual Testing

### Testing User Stories

#### First Time Visitor Goals

> * As a first time visitor, I want to be able to easily understand the purpose of the website and to learn more about the business.

The home page of the site serves the purpose of introducing the business and product to first time visitors.

> * As a first time visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate the site to access content without having to use the back button at any time.

The site has a clear and easy to follow nav bar that stays at the top of each page and indicates which page you are currently on. There are also buttons on the gallery page that encourage the visitor to continue to the contact page.

> * As a first time visitor, I want to look for testimonials to understand what their users think of them and see if they are trusted. I also want to locate their social media links to see their followings on social media to determine how trusted and known they are.

The home page features a reviews section where the business owner can showcase what has been said about their products in the past.

There are links to various social media platforms in the footer,  which stays at the bottom of the screen on each page.

#### Returning Visitor Goals

> * As a returning visitor, I want to be able to see new creations made by the business to see how often they are creating products.

The gallery page is designed to showcase the best and most recent products created by the company.

> * As a returning visitor, I want to know how to contact the business for more information if I wanted a design of my own.

Users are directed to the contact page from the gallery to encourage them to contact the business about any enquiries they may have.

#### Frequent User Goals

> * As a frequent user, I want to see new creations made by the business.

The gallery page is designed to showcase the best and most recent products created by the company. Future implementations of the site may include more features that keep visitors up to date on events and products.
