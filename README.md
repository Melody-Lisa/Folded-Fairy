This is the documentation for The Folded Fairy. The site has been built using HTML5 & CSS3 with minor javascript elements created through the use of Bootstrap for the Milestone 1 project for Code Institute's web development diploma.

## User Experience (UX)

### Strategy

 This project is inspired by a real creative project with the aim to show the owner of these creations an idea of what it would look like to expand their independent business with a simple website that showcases their portfolio along with allowing potential customers to contact them via social media or directly through the website.

- #### User Stories

  * __First Time Visitor Goals__

    a. As a first time visitor, I want to be able to easily understand the purpose of the website and to learn more about the business.
    
    b. As a first time visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate the site to access content without having to use the back button at any time.
    
    c. As a first time visitor, I want to look for testimonials to understand what their users think of them and see if they are trusted. I also want to locate their social media links to see their followings on social media to determine how trusted and known they are.

  * __Returning Visitor Goals__

    a. As a returning visitor, I want to be able to see new creations made by the business to see how often they are creating products.
    
    b. As a returning visitor, I want to know how to contact the business for more information if I wanted a design of my own.

  * __Frequent User Goals__
    
    a. As a frequent user, I want to see new creations made by the business.
    
    b. As a frequent visitor, I want to be able to check for new features as the website expands.

### Scope

Taking all of the above into account I decided that we would need three main pages to begin with;

* __Home Page:__ This would provide users with information about the business along with some reviews about the products that they sell.
* __Gallery Page:__ This would showcase some of the products previously created by the business for users to scroll through.
* __Contact Page:__ This would allow users to ask for more information or get a quote on a custom design of their choosing.

As well as the three main pages, links to the business' social media pages would be clearly shown in the footer to direct users to other sites that the business is active on.

These three pages give the client a good starting idea about the potential for having their own website with room to expand the site to include more features in the future.

-----

### Structure

As the site is starting out quite simply, the navigation route will be linear and will encourage users to read about the business, view some of the past products and then contact the business for more information. This will be the order that the pages appear in the navigation bar along with interactive calls to action and links within the content of the pages to encourage users to click over to the next area of the site.

## User Interface (UI) Design

### Surface

#### Typography

Fonts have been imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

* The [Luxurious Script](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Luxurious+Script?query=luxuriou) font has been used for the main title on each page along with subheadings and certain parts of the about section. "Cursive" is the fallback font in case the browser doesn't import the font correctly. I chose this style of font as I believe it compliments the style of the product.

* The [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?query=mont) font has been used for the main text across the site with "sans-serif" as fallback if the browser doesn't import the font correctly. This is a common font used in websites, is easy to read and provides good contrast with the title font.

#### Colours

I used [Paletton](http://paletton.com/) to research a colourscheme for the site. Based on the overview of the site I knew we wanted to include a natural element in the colourscheme to represent the nature of the products, along with a hint of femininity that represents the client's personality.

* __Antique White__ is the colour I chose for the background of various sections across the site. This was partly an accesibility choice that was made in the absence of a dark mode option. We wanted the site to appear light and airy without the harshness that can present with pure white. This slight off-white colour more closely fits with the yellow-tones that compliment the other colours in the triad without being distracting.

* __#04604E__ - This forest green is the colour I chose from using the paletton colour picker as the background for the entire page. It is bold but soft and contrasts well with the antique white to help highlight each section of the pages.

* __#EB5CAD__ - The original paletton triad pallet suggests a more purple-tone pink to go with the green. I decided I wanted something lighter and more feminine that would contrast with the deep colour of the green background. This shade of pink it used for elements in the header and footer along with various elements that require highlighting - including hover effects for buttons.
