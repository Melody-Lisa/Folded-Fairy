## User Experience (UX)

### Strategy

 This project is inspired by a real creative project with the aim to show the owner of these creations an idea of what it would look like to expand their independent business with a simple website that showcases their portfolio along with allowing potential customers to contact them via social media or directly through the website.

- #### User Stories

  * First Time Visitor Goals

    a. As a first time visitor, I want to be able to easily understand the purpose of the website and to learn more about the business.
    b. As a first time visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate the site to access content without having to use the back button at any time.
    c. As a first time visitor, I want to look for testimonials to understand what their users think of them and see if they are trusted. I also want to locate their social media links to see their followings on social media to determine how trusted and known they are.

  * Returning Visitor Goals

    a. As a returning visitor, I want to be able to see new creations made by the business to see how often they are creating products.
    b. As a returning visitor, I want to know how to contact the business for more information if I wanted a design of my own.

  * Frequent User Goals
    
    a. As a frequent user, I want to see new creations made by the business.
    b. As a frequent visitor, I want to be able to check for new features as the website expands.


### Scope

Taking all of the above into account I decided that we would need three main pages to begin with;

* __Home Page:__ This would provide users with information about the business along with some reviews about the products that they sell.
* __Gallery Page:__ This would showcase some of the products previously created by the business for users to scroll through.
* __Contact Page:__ This would allow users to ask for more information or get a quote on a custom design of their choosing.

As well as the three main pages, links to the business' social media pages would be clearly shown in the footer to direct users to other sites that the business is active on.

These three pages give the client a good starting idea about the potential for having their own website with room to expand the site to include more features in the future.

### Structure

As the site is starting out quite simply, the navigation route will be linear and will encourage users to read about the business, view some of the past products and then contact the business for more information. This will be the order that the pages appear in the navigation bar along with interactive calls to action and links within the content of the pages to encourage users to click over to the next area of the site.
